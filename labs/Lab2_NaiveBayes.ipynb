Stop here and take a browse through its <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html\">documentation</a>, to get an overview. You do not need to understand everything, or study it front to back, but try to get a feel for what kinds of stuff it contains, and how the programs using it are typically structured.\n",

    "Like many python libraries (one you might be quite familiat with is ```psychopy```), sklearn is based on object-oriented programming. Let's start with a quick intro, since I think understanding objects, methods and attributes will help you understand what's going on with the code we'll be using below. Personally, it took me quite some time to figure out exactly what objects are, and why they are so useful. If you have done any programming course in your life, you will have come across them sooner or later, and you'll probably have seen some pretty stupid examples, like this one:"

    "So, why bother? The reason why classes are useful is exactly their ability to store attributes and methods <b>internally</b>. In the above code, we had to define some global variables in the beginning of our script, and pass them into the function(s) we want to use. Whatever value is returned has to be stored in another variable, or else is forever lost. The function does not remember anything. Objects <b>remember</b> their attribute values. If you want to cycle again, the ```Bike``` object above will remember its current position and wheel diameter, and take it from there. The standalone cycle function won't do that - you have to pass its current position as an argument.\n",

    "\n",
    "For Machine Learning, this ability of objects to store and remember (so to say: \"learn\") information is extremely useful. For example, you can instantiate a specific type of model, train its parameters on some data, and then run it on that same data, additional data, etc. You might even throw away all the data altogether, and just keep the model parameters. All you need is the model object, and it remembers where its parameters (e.g., probabilities of observing certain words) are currently at. For some models, you can even update some parameters, using only new, freshly acquired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if the above introduction is not entirely clear to you. Hopefully you start thinking about python and the world of objects, and it helps you make sense about the way models and methods are used with sklearn. Btw, you probably already know quite a few objects: python strings, lists and dictionaries are all their own type of object, and they have class-specific methods you can call, such as ```.lower()``` for a string, or ```.sort()``` for a list. Psychopy modules also consist largely of objects."
