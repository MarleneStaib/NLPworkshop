    "This lab will introduce you to some basic tools and libraries commonly used for Data Science in python.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>```numpy``` is a library that efficiently stores matrices and vectors, called arrays. Some really clever people optimised this very well, so that it can do things such as dot products and data compression very efficiently.\n",
    "<li>```pandas``` offers some more R-like dataframes. A dataframe is more flexible than an array (for example, it can have strings and numbers in the same column).\n",
    "<li>```matplotlib``` is a plotting library.\n",
    "<li>```seaborn``` is built on top of matplotlib, and offers a few additional perks in the same style as ```matplotlib```.\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "## 1. Jupyter\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are interactive python notebooks, in which you can design your code and run each cell one by one. There are code cells and markdown cells. You can select the type of cell above: Cell > Cell Type. Use markdown cells to write notes for your future self or your collaborators/readers. Code cells run your code when you hit ```Ctrl + Enter```. In <b>command mode</b>, you can navigate through cells using the up/down arrows. With ```Enter```/double click, you get into <b>execute mode</b>, where you can modify and execute cells.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Create a new cell in command mode by hitting ```a``` (new cell above) or ```b``` (new cell below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Delete a cell in command mode by hitting ```d d```.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "A very neat feature of jupyter notebooks is that the output of the last command is automatically printed below a code cell, even without the print() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Try creating a new cell below (by default, this creates a new code cell), and put ```34 * 567``` in there. Execute the cell to see what happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Then, put ```34 / 567``` in there, below your previous line of code. What gets displayed? Two numbers, or just one? Which one?\n",

    "\n",
    "Numpy is a library for storing and fast computing with matrices and vectors. The basic data type in numpy is a nupy array (```np.array()```). An array can be unidimensional (vector), two dimensional (matrix) or higher dimensional (\"tensor\"; like a matrix of matrices, etc. - but don't worry about it too much for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "A one dimensional array is a bit like a list in python, except that it has a fixed size that has to be defined when the array is created. It also has a fixed datatype, e.g. ```np.int64``` (integers) or ```np.float```. All elements of the array must be of the same datatype, and tying to insert an item of a different data type will create errors. Here are a few ways of creating new arrays. Try to execute the cells below and figure out how these methods work.\n",

    "Numpy has many more useful functions and applications, and if you want to get deeper into Machine Learning in python, I encourage you to dive further into <a href=\"http://www.numpy.org/\">the numpy documentation</a>. For example, Neural Networks - the current state of the art in many areas of Machine Learning today - are hugely based on matrix multiplications. Even if you are a total champ at Linear Algebra, and could implement them all by yourself, many PhDs have gone into making numpy super fast and efficient, which is why you should always choose numpy instead. Btw, even Deep Learning Frameworks such as <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html\">pytorch</a> use similar data types and functions; so understanding them is a very transferrable skill!\n",

    "For now, we won't need a too in-depth understanding of numpy arrays and functions. Just know that they exist, and that some of the errors you might get are due to an array being of the wrong shape or datatype. Importantly, numpy functions can be applied to pandas DataFrame/Series objects, which we will be using in this course to store and manipulate data."
